# Spring-AngularJS-Java-Web-App-Template-Project
Now bringing you the much needed and long pending update to my previous Java Web App Template that I was trying to put together for quite some time now where I am showcasing a template project that can be taken as is to begin developing a modern AngularJS web app backed by Spring and Java.

The projects brings together Java, Spring 4, Spring MVC 4, Spring JPA, Hibernate, Angular JS, Twitter Bootstrap, JWT Token Authentication technology in a clean easy to use and bootstrap fashion. Dowanload and start building your next big thing in Java. Free your mind of scalability and other scares.
